# 👋 Hi, I'm Theto Mamabolo

💡 I'm a 16-year-old who genuinely *loves* to code.  
💻 I’m not in it for the hype or the money — I code because it's fun, exciting, and gives me the power to bring ideas to life.  
🎮 Right now, I’m building my own Python game called **Double Dare!** — a 2-player quiz battle game with health bars, streak bonuses, and difficulty levels.

### 🚀 My Coding Journey
I started learning Python with simple loops and logic, and now I’m making full games from scratch.  
Every error I fix, every feature I add — it makes me enjoy coding even more.  
I believe in learning slow, building real projects, and always improving.
